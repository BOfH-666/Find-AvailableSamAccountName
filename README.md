# Find-AvailableSamAccountName

Depending on the naming convention for the sAMAccountNames in an Active Directory Domain finding an available sAMAccountName can be tiring or exhausting - especially when done manually. This snippet helps managing this task easily. The default sAMAccountName in this example is the complete first name and the added first letter of the lastname. Of course that should be adapted to your particular naming schema.

Feel free to use it as it is or as inspiration for your own code. 🤟🏼😉
